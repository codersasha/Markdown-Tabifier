<h1>Project Initiation and Selection</h1>

<h2>What is a project?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Projects have:
<ul>
<li>Objectives</li>
<li>A start and end date</li>
<li>A budget</li>
<li>An owner/sponsor</li>
<li>Deliverables that are produced</li>
<li>Resources that are consumed</li>
<li>Vastly-varying size, complexity and duration
<ul>
<li>e.g. may be a phase within a larger project, or a phase within a program</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A project can be focused around:
<ul>
<li>Products</li>
<li>Processes</li>
<li>Reports</li>
<li>Events (e.g. the Olympics, a conference, etc)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While the project is temporary, the outcome may or may not be temporary</li>
<li>The product life cycle typically involves:
<ol>
<li>Project lifecycle</li>
<li>Operations and maintenance</li>
<li>Disposal</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h2>Why projects materialise</h2>

<ul>
<li>The project stages are:
<ol>
<li>Conception (pre-project)</li>
<li>Initation
<ul>
<li>Here, the project's objectives, scope and approach are defined, and the project team is mobilised</li>
<li>This stage involves:
<ol>
<li>Confirming the definition of the project</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implementation
<ul>
<li>Here, the workplan is executed to achieve desired outcomes</li>
<li>This stage involves:
<ol>
<li>Planning the execution</li>
<li>Organising the resources</li>
<li>Controlling the work</li>
<li>Reporting the status</li>
</ol></li>
<li>In this stage, the steps occur in a <em>cycle</em> as work continues</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Termination
<ul>
<li>Here, the project is wrapped up and transitioned</li>
<li>This stage involves:
<ol>
<li>Completing the project</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Strategic planning</strong> involves:
<ul>
<li>Determining long-term objectives</li>
<li>Predicting future trends</li>
<li>Projecting the need for new products/services</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Organisations often perform a <strong>SWOT analysis</strong> when undergoing strategic planning, which involves analysing:
<ol>
<li>Strengths</li>
<li>Weaknesses</li>
<li>Opportunities</li>
<li>Threats</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Projects come from 5 main business drivers for change:
<ul>
<li>Operational</li>
<li>Strategic</li>
<li>Regulatory</li>
<li>Financial</li>
<li>Environmental</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Business problems and opportunities use <em>realistic</em> methods to select which projects to work on, but evaluating which project generates the most value can be challenging</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparing the evaluation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Large organisations have a process for defining, evaluating and selecting projects, which usually involves:
<ol>
<li>Define high-level project objectives, scope and approach</li>
<li>Nominate the project sponsor, stakeholders and project manager</li>
<li>Identify the high-level business benefits, the high-level project costs, and evaluate economics</li>
<li>Identify potential risks</li>
<li>Develop a project proposal</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h3>Objectives, Scope &amp; Approach</h3>

<ul>
<li>Many projects fail as a result of getting the objectives, scope &amp; approach wrong
<ul>
<li>The <strong>objectives</strong> involve considering what, when and why</li>
<li>The <strong>scope</strong> specifies exactly what is included and excluded</li>
<li>The <strong>approach</strong> addresses <em>how</em> the project will be developed</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Objectives</h4>

<p><ul>
<li>One good way of setting objectives is to use <strong>SMART objectives</strong>, which are:
<ol>
<li>Specific (not open to interpretation)</li>
<li>Measurable</li>
<li>Agreed</li>
<li>Realistic (should not require superhuman effort)</li>
<li>Time bound (with an agreed-upon timeline)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>One good quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You cannot manage what you do not measure</li>
  </ul></p>
  
  <h4>Scope</h4>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>To define scope accurately, you must define what is <em>in</em> scope and what is <em>out</em> of scope</li>
<li>Dimensions of project scope may include:
<ul>
<li>Functional</li>
<li>Technical</li>
<li>Organisational</li>
<li>Geographic</li>
<li>Process</li>
<li>Time constraints</li>
<li>Human resource constraints</li>
<li>Deliverables to be produced</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Deliverables</strong> are the desired outcomes or results of a project
<ul>
<li>They are unique, tangible items</li>
<li>They support the project objectives</li>
<li>They can be a <em>product</em> (e.g. car, software application, house, training package, user guide), <em>process</em>, <em>report</em> or <em>event</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Assigning Sponsors</h3>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>project sponsor</strong> is an individual who has overall responsibility for the project
<ul>
<li>Usually, this is the head of business unit</li>
<li>They do not have day-to-day involvement in managing the project, but instead:
<ul>
<li>Provide project direction and leadership</li>
<li>Ensure the project has appropriate resources</li>
<li>Are responsible for the project outcome</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some ideal attributes of a project sponsor include:
<ul>
<li><em>Vision</em>: a clear definition of what changes must occur and competencies required</li>
<li><em>The long view</em>: an in-depth understanding of the effect the change will have on the organisation</li>
<li><em>Power</em>: the sanctioning power to legitimise the change with targets</li>
<li><em>Scope</em>: the capacity to understand thoroughly the size of the group to be affected by the change</li>
<li><em>A public role</em>: demonstrates public support &amp; commitment to change</li>
<li><em>A private role</em>: meets privately with individuals or groups to convey strong personal support for the change</li>
<li><em>A willingness to sacrifice</em>: the commitment to pursue the transition, knowing that there is a price</li>
<li><em>Pain</em>: a level of discomfort with the static quo that makes the change attractive</li>
<li><em>Resources</em>: a thorough understanding of the resources necessary for successful implementation, and the ability and willingness to commit them</li>
<li><em>Consequence management techniques</em>: prepared to reward supporters of change &amp; express displeasure with those who inhibit it</li>
<li><em>Sensitivity</em>: the capacity to fully appreciate and empathise with the personal issues major change raises</li>
<li><em>Persistence</em>: the capability to demonstrate consistent support for the change, and reject any short-term action that is inconsistent with long-term change goals</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Assigning Stakeholders</h3>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>stakeholder</strong> is an individual who is directly impacted by the project, and therefore must be proactively managed
<ul>
<li>This includes individuals or groups which will provide a service to, or get a service from the output of, a project</li>
<li>Stakeholders can also be related projects</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stakeholders can be classified as:
<ul>
<li><em>Critical</em>, which stop the project from achieving its objectives</li>
<li><em>Essential</em>, which can delay the project achieving its objectives</li>
<li><em>Non-essential</em>, which have an interest in the project</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These people are called 'stakeholders' because they have a 'stake' in the success of the project
<ul>
<li>Many projects have failed simply because a critical stakeholder was not acknowledged</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nominating the <strong>project manager</strong> may be based on:
<ul>
<li>Skills/experience (and whether they have done something like this before)</li>
<li>Availability</li>
<li>Someone the sponsor or primary client has worked with before</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A nominal person may be assigned (when choosing a project manager) to indicate that a person with this type of skill should be assigned</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benefits, Costs and Financial Evaluation</h3>

<ul>
<li>A new information system might have possible outcomes including:
<ul>
<li>automating monotonous jobs</li>
<li>reducing errors</li>
<li>expanding staff capabilities</li>
<li>facilitating additional customer services</li>
<li>providing better financial control</li>
<li>empowering managers</li>
<li>increased efficiency</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Financial considerations are often an important aspect of the project selection process, and involve determining the cost or benefit from a project
<ul>
<li>Methods for determining the projected financial value of projects using this information include:
<ul>
<li>A <em>net present value (NPV)</em> analysis</li>
<li>A <em>return on investment (ROI)</em> analysis</li>
<li>A <em>payback</em> analysis or <em>break even</em> analysis</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A <strong>cost-benefits analysis</strong> involves identifying and estimating all of the costs and benefits of carrying out the project
<ul>
<li>Costs can include:
<ul>
<li>Development costs</li>
<li>Setup costs</li>
<li>Operational costs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Benefits can include:
<ul>
<li>Direct benefits</li>
<li>Assessable indirect benefits</li>
<li>Intangible benefits</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can express these costs and benefits in common units
<ul>
<li>Benefits can be tangible or intangible
<ul>
<li><em>Tangible</em> benefits include:
<ul>
<li>cost reduction/avoidance</li>
<li>improved turn-around time (leading to shorter billing cycles)</li>
<li>stock reduction</li>
<li>improved control (and more accurate forecasting)</li>
<li>salary savings</li>
<li>broader market opportunities (e.g. via the internet)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Intangible</em> benefits include:
<ul>
<li>improved employee morale</li>
<li>improved customer satisfaction</li>
<li>improved corporate image</li>
<li>keeping up with the competition</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Costs can also be tangible or intangible
<ul>
<li><em>Tangible</em> costs include things for which ther are bills (invoices) and records of payments</li>
<li><em>Intangible</em> costs include:
<ul>
<li>loss of good will</li>
<li>downtime for a switch over</li>
<li>an opportunity cost (i.e. potential benefits that would accrue from other projects are no longer possible)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A <strong>net present value analysis</strong> involves taking into account the 'time value' of money
<ul>
<li>e.g. $100 now could be invested at the market rate of interest (cost of capital), and the return in a year's time in uncertain (e.g. inflation)</li>
<li>Income streams occuring over differing periods of time are difficult to compare - we need a common base value on which to make decisions
<ul>
<li>This helps when dealing with products with differing cash flows over different periods of time - we need to be able to differ the 'shape' to the cash flow (e.g. projects with small returns early and potentially greater returns later on, compared with projects with a fast return on investment)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <strong>discount rate</strong> is the rate of return used to calculate the present value of future cash flows (e.g. 10%)
<ul>
<li>We can use this rate to determine the present value of cash outlays and receipts</li>
<li>Excel has a function <em>NPV</em>, which calculates the net present value of an investment by using a discount rate and a series of future payments (negative values) and income (positive values)
<ul>
<li>Syntax: <code>NPV(rate, value1, value2, ...)</code></li>
<li>Formula: <code>PV(n) = Y x (1 / (1 + i) ^ N)</code>, where:
<ul>
<li><code>PV(n)</code> is the present value of <code>Y</code> dollars <code>n</code> years from now, based on a discount rate of <code>i</code></li>
<li><code>NPV</code> is the sum of <code>PV(n)</code>s across years</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <strong>present value</strong> is the current value of a future cash flow</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A <strong>payback/break-even analysis</strong> is the amount of time required for cumulative cash flow to equal initial and ongoing investment
<ul>
<li>In other words, its the point where the net profit (or NPV) reaches $0 (or becomes positive after being negative)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <strong>return-on-investment</strong> is given by:
<ul>
<li><code>ROI = (total discounted benefits - total discounted costs) / discounted costs</code></li>
<li>ROI is always a percentage (can be positive or negative, but bigger is better)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <strong>internal rate of return</strong> is the discount rate at which <code>NPV = 0</code> at the conclusion of the project
<ul>
<li>There is also an Excel function for this</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks</h3>

<ul>
<li>Some catalysts for, and hence types of, risks include:
<ul>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Technical</li>
<li>Schedule/time</li>
<li>Operational</li>
<li>Government regulation changes</li>

<h2>The evaluation</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Project selection</strong> involves formal approval by senior management
<ul>
<li>It involves a summary of each project within the business case</li>
<li>A scoring model may be used to compare project (e.g. a weighted scoring model)</li>
<li>Extensive comparative analysis is not always required - sometimes the case for a project is obviously compelling</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A <strong>Feasibility analysis</strong> involves considering whether a project is feasible in one or more areas, including:
<ul>
<li>Economic
<ul>
<li>Cost-benefit analysis</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Technical
<ul>
<li>Includes available technology, staff skills, the recruitment market, and organisational capability</li>
<li>e.g. Capability Maturity Model</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Operational
<ul>
<li>Considering whether it will fulfill the needs of the organisation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Schedule
<ul>
<li>Considering whether it c an be done in the time available</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>After approving a project, a <strong>statement of work</strong> should be developed
<ul>
<li>If the project is in-house, this is part of stategic planning, and organisations should formalise project initiation by issuing a <em>project charter</em> and assigning a development team</li>
<li>If the project is outsourced, the organisation can begin the <em>project procurement management process</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
