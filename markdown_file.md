# Project Initiation and Selection

## What is a project?
- Projects have:
    - Objectives
    - A start and end date
    - A budget
    - An owner/sponsor
    - Deliverables that are produced
    - Resources that are consumed
    - Vastly-varying size, complexity and duration
        - e.g. may be a phase within a larger project, or a phase within a program
- A project can be focused around:
    - Products
    - Processes
    - Reports
    - Events (e.g. the Olympics, a conference, etc)
- While the project is temporary, the outcome may or may not be temporary
- The product life cycle typically involves:
    1. Project lifecycle
    2. Operations and maintenance
    3. Disposal
    
## Why projects materialise
- The project stages are:
    1. Conception (pre-project)
    2. Initation
        - Here, the project's objectives, scope and approach are defined, and the project team is mobilised
        - This stage involves:
            1. Confirming the definition of the project
    3. Implementation
        - Here, the workplan is executed to achieve desired outcomes
        - This stage involves:
            1. Planning the execution
            2. Organising the resources
            3. Controlling the work
            4. Reporting the status
        - In this stage, the steps occur in a *cycle* as work continues
    4. Termination
        - Here, the project is wrapped up and transitioned
        - This stage involves:
            1. Completing the project
- **Strategic planning** involves:
    - Determining long-term objectives
    - Predicting future trends
    - Projecting the need for new products/services
- Organisations often perform a **SWOT analysis** when undergoing strategic planning, which involves analysing:
    1. Strengths
    2. Weaknesses
    3. Opportunities
    4. Threats
- Projects come from 5 main business drivers for change:
    - Operational
    - Strategic
    - Regulatory
    - Financial
    - Environmental
- Business problems and opportunities use *realistic* methods to select which projects to work on, but evaluating which project generates the most value can be challenging
    
## Preparing the evaluation
- Large organisations have a process for defining, evaluating and selecting projects, which usually involves:
    1. Define high-level project objectives, scope and approach
    2. Nominate the project sponsor, stakeholders and project manager
    3. Identify the high-level business benefits, the high-level project costs, and evaluate economics
    4. Identify potential risks
    5. Develop a project proposal

### Objectives, Scope & Approach
- Many projects fail as a result of getting the objectives, scope & approach wrong
    - The **objectives** involve considering what, when and why
    - The **scope** specifies exactly what is included and excluded
    - The **approach** addresses *how* the project will be developed
#### Objectives
- One good way of setting objectives is to use **SMART objectives**, which are:
    1. Specific (not open to interpretation)
    2. Measurable
    3. Agreed
    4. Realistic (should not require superhuman effort)
    5. Time bound (with an agreed-upon timeline)
- One good quote:
> You cannot manage what you do not measure

#### Scope
- To define scope accurately, you must define what is *in* scope and what is *out* of scope
- Dimensions of project scope may include:
    - Functional
    - Technical
    - Organisational
    - Geographic
    - Process
    - Time constraints
    - Human resource constraints
    - Deliverables to be produced
- **Deliverables** are the desired outcomes or results of a project
    - They are unique, tangible items
    - They support the project objectives
    - They can be a *product* (e.g. car, software application, house, training package, user guide), *process*, *report* or *event*
    
### Assigning Sponsors
- A **project sponsor** is an individual who has overall responsibility for the project
    - Usually, this is the head of business unit
    - They do not have day-to-day involvement in managing the project, but instead:
        - Provide project direction and leadership
        - Ensure the project has appropriate resources
        - Are responsible for the project outcome
- Some ideal attributes of a project sponsor include:
    - *Vision*: a clear definition of what changes must occur and competencies required
    - *The long view*: an in-depth understanding of the effect the change will have on the organisation
    - *Power*: the sanctioning power to legitimise the change with targets
    - *Scope*: the capacity to understand thoroughly the size of the group to be affected by the change
    - *A public role*: demonstrates public support & commitment to change
    - *A private role*: meets privately with individuals or groups to convey strong personal support for the change
    - *A willingness to sacrifice*: the commitment to pursue the transition, knowing that there is a price
    - *Pain*: a level of discomfort with the static quo that makes the change attractive
    - *Resources*: a thorough understanding of the resources necessary for successful implementation, and the ability and willingness to commit them
    - *Consequence management techniques*: prepared to reward supporters of change & express displeasure with those who inhibit it
    - *Sensitivity*: the capacity to fully appreciate and empathise with the personal issues major change raises
    - *Persistence*: the capability to demonstrate consistent support for the change, and reject any short-term action that is inconsistent with long-term change goals

### Assigning Stakeholders
- A **stakeholder** is an individual who is directly impacted by the project, and therefore must be proactively managed
    - This includes individuals or groups which will provide a service to, or get a service from the output of, a project
    - Stakeholders can also be related projects
- Stakeholders can be classified as:
    - *Critical*, which stop the project from achieving its objectives
    - *Essential*, which can delay the project achieving its objectives
    - *Non-essential*, which have an interest in the project
- These people are called 'stakeholders' because they have a 'stake' in the success of the project
    - Many projects have failed simply because a critical stakeholder was not acknowledged
- Nominating the **project manager** may be based on:
    - Skills/experience (and whether they have done something like this before)
    - Availability
    - Someone the sponsor or primary client has worked with before
- A nominal person may be assigned (when choosing a project manager) to indicate that a person with this type of skill should be assigned
    
### Benefits, Costs and Financial Evaluation
- A new information system might have possible outcomes including:
    - automating monotonous jobs
    - reducing errors
    - expanding staff capabilities
    - facilitating additional customer services
    - providing better financial control
    - empowering managers
    - increased efficiency
- Financial considerations are often an important aspect of the project selection process, and involve determining the cost or benefit from a project
    - Methods for determining the projected financial value of projects using this information include:
        - A *net present value (NPV)* analysis
        - A *return on investment (ROI)* analysis
        - A *payback* analysis or *break even* analysis
- A **cost-benefits analysis** involves identifying and estimating all of the costs and benefits of carrying out the project
    - Costs can include:
        - Development costs
        - Setup costs
        - Operational costs
    - Benefits can include:
        - Direct benefits
        - Assessable indirect benefits
        - Intangible benefits
    - We can express these costs and benefits in common units
        - Benefits can be tangible or intangible
            - *Tangible* benefits include:
                - cost reduction/avoidance
                - improved turn-around time (leading to shorter billing cycles)
                - stock reduction
                - improved control (and more accurate forecasting)
                - salary savings
                - broader market opportunities (e.g. via the internet)
            - *Intangible* benefits include:
                - improved employee morale
                - improved customer satisfaction
                - improved corporate image
                - keeping up with the competition
        - Costs can also be tangible or intangible
            - *Tangible* costs include things for which ther are bills (invoices) and records of payments
            - *Intangible* costs include:
                - loss of good will
                - downtime for a switch over
                - an opportunity cost (i.e. potential benefits that would accrue from other projects are no longer possible)
- A **net present value analysis** involves taking into account the 'time value' of money
    - e.g. $100 now could be invested at the market rate of interest (cost of capital), and the return in a year's time in uncertain (e.g. inflation)
    - Income streams occuring over differing periods of time are difficult to compare - we need a common base value on which to make decisions
        - This helps when dealing with products with differing cash flows over different periods of time - we need to be able to differ the 'shape' to the cash flow (e.g. projects with small returns early and potentially greater returns later on, compared with projects with a fast return on investment)
    - The **discount rate** is the rate of return used to calculate the present value of future cash flows (e.g. 10%)
        - We can use this rate to determine the present value of cash outlays and receipts
        - Excel has a function *NPV*, which calculates the net present value of an investment by using a discount rate and a series of future payments (negative values) and income (positive values)
            - Syntax: `NPV(rate, value1, value2, ...)`
            - Formula: `PV(n) = Y x (1 / (1 + i) ^ N)`, where:
                - `PV(n)` is the present value of `Y` dollars `n` years from now, based on a discount rate of `i`
                - `NPV` is the sum of `PV(n)`s across years
    - The **present value** is the current value of a future cash flow
- A **payback/break-even analysis** is the amount of time required for cumulative cash flow to equal initial and ongoing investment
    - In other words, its the point where the net profit (or NPV) reaches $0 (or becomes positive after being negative)
- The **return-on-investment** is given by:
    - `ROI = (total discounted benefits - total discounted costs) / discounted costs`
    - ROI is always a percentage (can be positive or negative, but bigger is better)
- The **internal rate of return** is the discount rate at which `NPV = 0` at the conclusion of the project
    - There is also an Excel function for this
    
### Risks
- Some catalysts for, and hence types of, risks include:
    - Cost
    - Technical
    - Schedule/time
    - Operational
    - Government regulation changes
    - Legal issues
    - Marketplace developments
    - Funding problems
    - Organisational strategy changes

## The evaluation
- **Project selection** involves formal approval by senior management
    - It involves a summary of each project within the business case
    - A scoring model may be used to compare project (e.g. a weighted scoring model)
    - Extensive comparative analysis is not always required - sometimes the case for a project is obviously compelling
- A **Feasibility analysis** involves considering whether a project is feasible in one or more areas, including:
    - Economic
        - Cost-benefit analysis
    - Technical
        - Includes available technology, staff skills, the recruitment market, and organisational capability
        - e.g. Capability Maturity Model
    - Operational
        - Considering whether it will fulfill the needs of the organisation
    - Schedule
        - Considering whether it c an be done in the time available
- After approving a project, a **statement of work** should be developed
    - If the project is in-house, this is part of stategic planning, and organisations should formalise project initiation by issuing a *project charter* and assigning a development team
    - If the project is outsourced, the organisation can begin the *project procurement management process*
